# About Me

I obtained my PhD from the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.tamu.edu/) at Texas A&M University in August 2022, under the supervision of [Michael Anshelevich](https://math.tamu.edu/~manshel/). My dissertation lies in the fields of operator algebras and free, or non-commutative, probability theory. I am currently on the job market.
